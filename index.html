					plants.</li>

				<li><time>1941</time> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead,
					the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other
					applied science.</li>


				<li><time>1942</time> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology.</li>


				<li><time>1944</time> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupong, Leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies
					to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different
					strains of desease resisten wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>

				<li><time>1945</time> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields.</li>


				<li><time>1953</time> - Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed,
					creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>

				<li><time>2005</time> - BStates "We will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically
					modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are
					not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long
					before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds.".</li>


				<li><time>2009</time> - Dies at the age of 95.</li>
